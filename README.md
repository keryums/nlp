# USF Natural Language Processing Final Project

For this project, I explored Structural Topic Modelling (STM) on Amazon reviews using R's `stm` package. 
The point of STM is to incorporate covariate information (i.e. document-level metadata) into a standard topic model. 
Some hypothesize that doing so helps latent topics better emerge. Part of this exercise will be comparing the topics coming out
of STM to those generated by regular LDA, NMF, and Correlation Explanation (CorEx). 

Here are some links about STM:
